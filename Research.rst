**Optical Wireless Communication (OWC)** is a short-range wireless access technology and an important supplement to other 
existing wireless communication systems. Due to the high frequency of light waves, OWC has large information carrying capacity.
Light waves also have rich broadband spectrum resources and strong anti-electromagnetic interference capabilities compared with radio frequency. 
In addition, OWC based on semiconductor light source are highly power efficient. 
With the technological breakthroughs of optoelectronic materials and devices, the cost of OWC will be further reduced, 
OWC technology will have a competitive advantage and transformative value that cannot be underestimated in the future information
society where everything is connected.

**Silicon photonics** is a promising solution to provide low-cost and high-performance integrated chip-based photonic devices and systems. 
Currently, it is commercially driven by the increasing demand for low-cost short-range optical interconnects in data centers and the computing industry.
In the future, it might also be attractive for applications in biosensing and light detection and ranging (LiDAR). 
Our group focus on design of key passive integrated components including fiber-to-chip interface, waveguide crossings and multiplexing components 
(polarization, mode and wavelength division multiplexing). Apart from traditional design method based on intuition and 
physics, we also explore computer-automated design using advanced algorithms and deep neural networks.

**3D-Sensing (LiDAR, OCT):**
FMCW LiDAR (Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave, Light Detection and Ranging) allows us to measure distance with millimeter or micrometer range 
resolution, which can be applied in high accuracy 3D sensing and mapping. Swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) with high precision 
in 3D reconstructions of biological tissues also relies on this technique. In addition, we also try to combine with other research field such as 
femtosecond mode-locked laser to set up fancy LiDAR system.

**Microcavity Sensing:**
Whispering gallery mode (WGM) resonators, with superior performance compared with other resonators, 
have emerged in recent years as versatile and ultra-sensitive technology for sensing applications, 
which is the basis for the development of physical, chemical and biological sensors. 
In our research group, we use micro-cavity (e.g. Microbubble) to realize different sensing applications, 
such as ultra-low detection limit sensors.

| **Optical nonlinearity:**
| **(1) Ultrafast mode-locked fiber** lasers exhibit superior thermo-optical properties and excellent beam quality, 
 making them suitable for a wide range of applications. We have constructed several nonlinear amplifying loop 
 mirror (NALM)-based fiber lasers, which can generate pulses with good optical performance or interesting nonlinear phenomena. 
| **(2)** Much efforts have made to the generation of broadband light due to its promising applications such as high-precision
 frequency metrology, optical coherence tomography and optical communications. We have demonstrated **supercontinuum generation**
 in a highly nonlinear dispersion shifted fiber.
